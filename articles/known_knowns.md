[Dinosaur-Killing Space Rock 'Was a Comet'](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-21709229/)

I read this a few days ago on the BBC (via hacker news) Interesting, logical & all... but that second to last paragraph has been bouncing around in my head all weekend. 'cause yeah.... dubious at best.

> "Some 95% of near-Earth objects larger then 1km have been discovered. However, only about 10% of the 13,000 - 20,000 astroids above the size of 140m are being tracked."

Really? Wouldn't a statement like 95% of X imply that you know 100% of X? The article is good, but maybe Paul Rincon & his Editor should leave the maths to the professionals.

In closing some words from professional grumpy old man & master wordsmith Donald Rumsfeld.

>"There are known knowns. These are things we know that we know. There are known unknowns. That is to say, there are things that we know we don't know. But there are also unknown unknowns. There are things we don't know we don't know."
