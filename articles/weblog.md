### This is your weblog.  
Articles with the `:section:` tag of 'blog' will be ordered by the **DATE THE ARTICLE WAS LAST UPDATED**. The value of the `:weight:` tag will be ignored for weblog articles. However a value may be set as changeing the `:section:` tag to 'home' or 'contact' will change the section of the site where the article is displayed.

#### You should write cool thigs here
This site can also highlight code. Use standard markdown *(paired backticks for inline code or four spaces of indentation for block code)*. The Syntax highlighter as well as anyother color/style options can me set in the `.scss` files in the `/views` subdirectory.

    :::ruby
		class Hello
			def say_hello(name)
				puts "Hello #{name}!"
			end 
		end
