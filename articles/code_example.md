### Colours!!  
I will likely be talking about code here every now & so it could be rather usefull to have some code hilighting. It seems that coderay is all ready being pulled in by something in my Gemfile (Authoritative eh?) As I am alreay useing markdown for my articles & sinatra is allready pluged in to rack it should be as simple as loading up the rack-codehilighter gem and magic.


    :::ruby
    def hello
      puts"Hi!"
    end

If that works (you shouldn't see a ruby decleration) then everything is magic!  

***UPDATE:*** *It does seem to work rather well! However, the indentation seems to be a little wonky, and I don't have any styles for the highlight. But the syntax is wraped in the appropriate classes.*

***BOOM:*** *Indentation fixed. Now for some pretty pretty & general eyeball licking...*
