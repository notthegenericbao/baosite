### A framework for creatieng ambitious web applications 
Or a framework with a prodigious learning curve 0o. After my initial pro to type of the HexScan app for The Void not only worked exactly as I expected, but had the bonus of returning accurate results as well, I decided to re-write in in a 'proper' web app framework. Mainly to show of… But also so I would have something neato & functional in my portfolio. 

Having noticed a a few articles on Hacker News with some rather intense discussion I decided to investigate. Ember.js is the evolution of SproutCore 2.0, SproutCore is apparently the framework that the iCloud/MobileMe web apps are written in. Don't really care about that.

What did catch my eye though is that Yehuda Katz is one of the guys behind it. I'm not the worlds biggest fan of rails but pretty much every time I read something on his blog I learn something new. So I figure he's a clever guy & warrants some attention. 

###So what exactly is Ember.js? 
Quite simply its an MVC framework written in javascript, for making full on client side web apps. *(Think more palm pre app & not so much scripted web page interaction)*. Additionally, Ember.js MVC is not so much the oddly abstracted Ruby on Rails server side MVC so much as its more Smalltalk-80 style MVC. That's pretty damn cool.


### I've heard that it's astoundingly, ridiculously, hard to learn…
Well… not so much. At its core its just javascript. Admittedly out of the box I was able to get it to do next to nothing. But a few nights with JavaScript: The Definitive Guide 6th edition, a quick read through of my Smalltalk-80 book for nostalgia's sake & some rather difficult to find educational videos from the internets (and the good folks on StackOverflow), I was able to hack together a fairly alright v0.0.2 of HexScan.

Now that I am starting to get the hang of it I feel like its a pretty fine solution for client side interactions. There is a decent community, and I've had an all right time using sinatra as a backend. There is a lot of work going on on the hooking-it-up-to rails side of things if thats your bag. But I am rather happy with sinatra. I think I'll be even more happy with it once I figure out ember-data and really get it screaming. But thats a story for another day.
